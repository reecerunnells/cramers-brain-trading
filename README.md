## Inspiration

The inspiration for this Google Firebase Function comes straight from [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship) and this repo [cramer-algo-trader](https://github.com/fireship-io/cramer-algo-trader). I basically thought this was a hilarious idea, because it is, so I decided to try my hand at some Google Puppeteer, OpenAI GPT-3 AI, and the Alpaca Trading API.
